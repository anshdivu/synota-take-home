# Synota Take Home

The task is as follows:

- Build a server-side app (REST API) that can do the following:
- Secure Login
- Permissioned access and control of a resource (perhaps a todo list)
- Non volatile memory to persist across restarts (SQL database, perhaps)

- It should have tests that automatically run in CI/CD (perhaps GH Actions)
- It should deploy to a host upon successful automated testing (perhaps heroku, render, fly.io, etc.)
